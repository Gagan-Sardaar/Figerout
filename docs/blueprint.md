## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple/violet (#4A148C) for a sophisticated and modern feel. Chosen to resonate with a feeling of rich and luxurious discovery. The rich purple alludes to royalty and visual delight. The background color will contrast with purple without overpowering it.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) in light mode for a clean backdrop, and dark blue/gray (#263238) in dark mode for a modern contrast.
- Accent color: Analogous to the primary color, a muted blue-purple (#673AB7), with brightness and saturation adjusted to make sure it is clearly distinguished from both background and the primary, to ensure that call to action components stand out.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a bold and stylish display, as requested. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for readability, as requested. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Clean, minimalist icons from 'shadcn/ui' to maintain a modern aesthetic.
- Mobile-first, full-screen immersive design for a premium user experience.
